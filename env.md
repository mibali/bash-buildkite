Hi there,

I understand that you are having an issue with setting environment variables in Buildkite. I'm happy to help you troubleshoot this issue.

The problem is that you are trying to set the environment variables in the agent environment hook, but this hook is only executed before the pipeline starts. The docker plugin step is executed after the pipeline has started, so the environment variables that you set in the agent environment hook will not be available to the docker plugin step.

To solve this issue, You can do either of the following but option 2 is the most recommended to follow standard practice:

**Option 1:** you can set the environment variables in the pipeline.yaml file. You can do this by adding the following to the steps section:
```
environment:
  USER: JohnDoe
  PASSWORD: Welcome@123
```
This will set the USER and PASSWORD environment variables to the values JohnDoe and Welcome@123 respectively. The docker plugin step will then be able to access these environment variables.

Here is the updated pipeline.yaml file:

pipeline.yaml
```
steps:
- label: ":hammer: Tests"
command: echo $USER $PASSWORD
plugins:
docker#v3.5.0:
user: root
image: ubuntu
environment:
  USER: JohnDoe
  PASSWORD: Welcome@123
```

**Option2 :** you can use the Buildkite agent's environment hook to export secrets to a job.
The environment hook is a shell script that is sourced at the beginning of a job. It runs within the job's shell, so you can use it to conditionally run commands and export secrets within the job. By default, the environment hook file is stored in the agent's hooks directory.

When it comes to using environment variables in Buildkite pipelines, following best practices ensures security, maintainability, and flexibility. Here are some recommended best practices for managing environment variables in Buildkite pipelines:

**Sensitive Information:**
Avoid storing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or tokens directly as plain text environment variables in pipeline scripts. Instead, use Buildkite's built-in secret management or third-party secret management solutions to securely store and retrieve sensitive data.

**Use Buildkite's Environment Settings:**
Buildkite provides an environment settings feature that allows you to define and manage environment variables within the Buildkite interface. These environment settings are encrypted and can be easily referenced in your pipeline steps.

**Least Privilege Principle:**
Only provide the necessary permissions to the environment variables. Limit access to environment settings to specific users or teams who require them, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Clear Variable Names:**
Use clear and descriptive variable names to make it easier for you and your team to understand the purpose of each variable.

I hope this helps!

Let me know if you have any other questions.
