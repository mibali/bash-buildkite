Hi there,

I understand that you are having an issue with setting environment variables in Buildkite. I'm happy to help you troubleshoot this issue.

The problem is that you are trying to set the environment variables in the agent environment hook, but this hook is only executed before the pipeline starts. The docker plugin step is executed after the pipeline has started, so the environment variables that you set in the agent environment hook will not be available to the docker plugin step.

To solve this issue, you need to set the environment variables in the pipeline.yaml file. You can do this by adding the following to the steps section:
```
environment:
  USER: JohnDoe
  PASSWORD: Welcome@123
```
This will set the USER and PASSWORD environment variables to the values JohnDoe and Welcome@123 respectively. The docker plugin step will then be able to access these environment variables.

Here is the updated pipeline.yaml file:

pipeline.yaml
```
steps:
- label: ":hammer: Tests"
command: echo $USER $PASSWORD
plugins:
docker#v3.5.0:
user: root
image: ubuntu
environment:
  USER: JohnDoe
  PASSWORD: Welcome@123
```
I hope this helps!

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,
Michael
